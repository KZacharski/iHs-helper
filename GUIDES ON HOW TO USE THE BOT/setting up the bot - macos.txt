CONFIGURE PACKAGE MANAGER
First of all you will have to install homebrew.
To do that just paste this command into your terminal and follow the instructions: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

BASICS

to make the bot start, you will need to install node.js first.
You can do that with a command: brew install node

after that, in iHs-helper folder type in command: bash open-me-on-linux-and-mac.sh

then you will have to do some things by hand, sadly at this moment I cannot give you precise instruction or setup script. Soon there will be setup.sh. At this moment getting the bot working needs some technical knowledge.

you will need your bot's token. to get that, read how to get the token.txt
